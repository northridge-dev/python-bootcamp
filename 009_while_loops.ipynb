    "Functions are one way to bundle up code so it can be reused. Loops are a second way. And a loop that executes a block of code again and again *as long as* or ***while*** some condition is true is called a `while` loop. Here's an example. `count` is set to `0` when it is created. What do you think `count` will equal once the code finishes executing?"

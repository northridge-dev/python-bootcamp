    "Python has a second type of loop, a **`for` loop**. It's more common, arguably easier to use correctly, and especially helpful if you need to perform some operations for every element in a list (or, similarly, for every character in a string). You've already seen an example. This look familiar?"

    "`for` and `while` loops both have a code block that's executed on each loop, but in place of the `while` loop's condition, a `for` loop has a list (or other [iterator]() -- we'll learn more about those later) that it works through. So the pattern is:\n",

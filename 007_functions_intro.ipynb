But this is critical: **the function body must be indented consistently!** It's typical to indent top-level code a tab or four spaces. Any further indendention -- for example, the line that starts `capitalized +=` -- is *on top of* the baseline function-body indentation. Indentation is how Python knows what code belongs to the function and what code is outside the function. (Other programming languages use something like braces (`{}`) to surround a function body, but Python relies on indentation.)"

Not every Python function has a return statement; the purpose of such function is typically to perform a \"side effect\", for example, printing something to the screen. In such cases, Python implicitly returns `None`."
